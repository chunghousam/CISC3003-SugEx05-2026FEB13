                            <p>Today I learned about HTML5 semantic elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;. These elements provide better structure and accessibility for web pages. I practiced creating a basic page structure and understood the importance of semantic HTML for SEO and screen readers.</p>

                            <p>Explored CSS Flexbox and Grid systems for creating responsive layouts. Flexbox is excellent for one-dimensional layouts, while Grid excels at two-dimensional layouts. I practiced creating various layouts including navigation bars, card grids, and complex page structures. The key is understanding when to use each approach.</p>

                            <p>Started learning JavaScript basics including variables, functions, arrays, and objects. Then moved to DOM manipulation - selecting elements, modifying content, handling events. Created interactive elements like buttons that change content dynamically. JavaScript makes websites truly interactive!</p>

Key concepts include fluid layouts, flexible images, and breakpoints. Tested designs on various devices and browsers to ensure compatibility.</p>

                            My primary academic goal is to complete my undergraduate degree in Computer Science with distinction, 
                            focusing on web technologies and software engineering. I aim to master both theoretical foundations 
                            and practical applications, building a strong portfolio of projects that demonstrate my technical 
                            capabilities. Following my undergraduate studies, I plan to pursue graduate studies to deepen my 
                            expertise and contribute to research in web technologies and user experience design.

                        <p>
                            Looking back on my academic and personal journey, I recognize significant growth in both 
                            technical skills and personal development. The process of learning web programming has 
                            been transformative, teaching me not just how to code, but how to think systematically, 
                            solve problems creatively, and persist through challenges.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Creating this personal website has been particularly meaningful. It represents not just 
                            a technical project, but a reflection of who I am, what I value, and where I'm heading. 
                            The process of planning, designing, and implementing this site has reinforced my passion 
                            for web development and confirmed my career direction.
